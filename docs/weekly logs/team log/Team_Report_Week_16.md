# Team 21 - 01/22 to 01/28

## Overview


This week our team finished several key tasks, enhancing both frontend and backend aspects of our projects. Highlights include successfully implementing the **ChatList** screen and enabling network requests on the **CreateAd** screen, allowing for smooth image uploads. We efficiently managed scheduled meetings, led team discussions, and conducted thorough code reviews for ongoing projects.

While making notable progress, we encountered challenges with authentication. Despite achieving successful user logins, concerns arose due to asynchronous operations potentially causing issues in the event loop. Solutions are being explored, including options like wrapping requests in promises or using try-catch blocks.

The implementation of stack navigation ensures seamless parameter transfer between the **Home** and **View post** screens. Focused frontend development efforts were dedicated to both screens, involving tasks such as retrieving user profile information and refining the login and registration processes.

Additionally, we achieved significant milestones in the backend, including successful refresh token authentication, user profile retrieval from the backend, and robust functionality for storing ads with images in the database.
