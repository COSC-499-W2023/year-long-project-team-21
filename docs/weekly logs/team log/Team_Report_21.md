Team 21 - 03/04 to 03/10

## Overview

This week we focused on getting our app ready for Thursday's peer evaluations. We pushed to complete our last two big feaures (location and messages), made several small improvements 
to the front end to make our app look as good as possible, and coordinated to connect the back end and front end for several features.
