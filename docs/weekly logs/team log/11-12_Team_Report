# Team 21 - 10/05 to 10/12

## Overview

This week we worked on restructuring the login, registration, and welcome page so they look more like the figma design. We started off first by dividing working on the components that will be re-used by other parts of the app to different 
group members. After that, we divided the work based on page. Reusable code is important to us. Backend work done includes creating a new user and model correct model implementation. We also discussed testing and documentation stratagies. 
Now that we are pretty adjusted to the development environment, we aim to get more features done this coming reading week.
