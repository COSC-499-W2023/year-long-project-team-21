# Team 21 - 02/11 to 02/18

## Overview

After fixing up all of our bugs from the Peer Review, we are now working on the last bit of big features for our second round of peer evals during the first week of March. This includes hooking up the messaages front end to the back end being worked on by Sten and Egor, location services being worked on by Gerren, catagories and ratings being worked on by Sten and Nicholas, and the ability to update/edit the profile/ads by Kei. Egor worked on refining his create-ad screen waiting for Sten to finish and Gerren and Keizo fixed up a bug for lazy loading and the View Post component.
