Team 21 - 11/27 to 12/03

## Overview

Our team keeps team meetings on Monday or Tuesday to review each others' progress and decide on tasks for the upcoming week. This week our main focus was to prepare for the demo video and design document submission.

On the frontend part an access to location services was improved and polished, making UX better. For the SQLite caching, we decided to shift it on Term 2 and focus on the UI part of the app. Thus, CreateAd page was created with several supporting components. The implementation changed to a single screen, as our designed version appeared to be overly complex technically. Navigation has been set up between the pages, though this part is not totally complete and needs improvements later in development.

On the backend part, works on media storage still in progress, even though Django has a pre-built solution, it has to be adapted to our needs properly.

A working build of the app was composed for the demo video, additional ER, navigation, and system architecture diagrams has been created for the Design document.
