# Team 21 - 10/09 to 10/15

## Overview

For this week, we decided to focus on our app's UI and database design. We had a meeting about the first draft of the UI design and gave feedback for further improvement. 
We also started to set up an environment for react native and Django while we started to debate if we should use Firebase to skip writing our own API for backend communication.
