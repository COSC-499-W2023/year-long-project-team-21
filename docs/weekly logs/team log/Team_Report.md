# Team 21 - 01/28 to 02/04

## Overview

Lots of work was done this week connecting all of our components together to form our actual app. It works pretty good, but we have a bug or two that we will post on our bug board (mostly considering Lazy Loading). This next week, we are going to change our prodecure to administer PR's into development/master before we begin any new feature. We will also be deciding on whether or not to divide our team between bug fixes and new features since there are so many of us. The next big features we need to work on are location, messages, and editing either account or a user's own ads.
