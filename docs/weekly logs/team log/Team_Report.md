# Team 21 - 01/08 to 01/14

## Overview

This week we focused on re-evaulauting our timeline, going through client and peer feedback, redesigning our figma, and assigning tasks to be worked on for the next couple of weeks. We are giving more work per member on our team so we can safely meet our deadlines. We have a few questions we have that we want to ask our client regarding location services and how we are doing it as we feel we are doing it a little different than other people. There was some work done during the break that we are going to approve PR's in the next couple of days.
