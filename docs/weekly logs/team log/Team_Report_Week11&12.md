Team 21 - 11/13 to 11/19 & 11/20 to 11/26

## Overview

Our team continues to a team meeting on Monday or Tuesday to review each others' progress and decide and delegate tasks for the upcoming week. This week on the front end we worked on setting SQLLite which will 
be needed to later implement the create ad and messaging components. We also added to ability to get the user location from the device to be used when registering users or creating ads. Lastly we also created a 
tab bar component with reusable icon components for our UI. On the backend we were first focused on getting our authentication set up so we can securely make requests and responses. The authentication is now 
working using REST framework JWT tokens utilizing both refresh and access tokens. After authentication the backend was updated so POST requests can be handled to allow users to create advertisments for food. 
In the upcoming week we will be focused on completing our design milestone and demo video.
