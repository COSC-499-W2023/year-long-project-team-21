# Team 21 - 09/25 to 10/01

## Overview

In week 4, we dedicated a lot of time to working through the details of client requirements to form to refine usage scenarios and finalize the Giver and Receiver usage experience. This greatly helped us to define the scope of our MVP and any additional features we plan to implement beyond the MVP stage. Besides, as a part of the project plan, our team agreed on the project's tech stack for both front end - React Native with TypeScript, which gives us freedom from having to learn 2 separate frameworks for iOS and Android and back end - Django with PostgreSQL, which handles many security issues, easy to use, and has built-in admin user functionality. During our online/in-person meetings, we also decided on specializations among our team.  It is not strict, so everyone can help with everything, but some of us will dig deeper into certain areas, which will help us work better as a team.
