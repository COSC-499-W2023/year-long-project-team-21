## Completed Features For This Week

- Scheduled meetings and led meetings
- Helped Nicholas
- Worked on code reviews.
- Kinda got a little stuck on authentication. I want users to be able to sign in if they are trying to access secure endpoints. I have a session stroage that stores the token, refresh token, and user_id. If this session is null I want the user to log in. I have this working but I'm kind of worried about async programming here. I have a lot await keywords happening and I'm worried that this process could get stuck in the event loop. So I'm just letting it ruminate in my mind for a bit. Worst case scenario I will just use promises to wrap the request around with or a try catch block.
