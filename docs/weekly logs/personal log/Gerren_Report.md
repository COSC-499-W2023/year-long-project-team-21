## My Features For This Week

I probably spent more than 20+ hours this week working on Capstone. 

I got the Location Services working. It works decently well. Can find ads given a certain radious based on a dropdown. I also implemented state across the whole React Native app, implemented a asynchrnous storage that keeps track of if the app was first loaded, a loading screen that asks the phones api if location services are enabled, also added longitude and latitude to the create new ad, changed the backend so it uses a library called GeoDjango which handles location stuff for me, had to change the database too to allow distance based queries, and I also edited the view to store a location on a new ad and created an endpoint for querying all ads within a certain radius. Eck. Cleaned up some serialziers as well. 

Then after that, I had to get help Nicholas w/ his code. Then I had to connect everything together late Wednesday night...
