## My Features For This Week

I don't know why but it looks like I didn't submit last weeks Peer Eval even though I did it (with a screen shot to prove). 

This week I focused on implementing Location Services, that is, loading in ads that are nearby. This will take me a couple of weeks to implemenet fully but I am confident I can do it in time. I began with scoping the assignment, asked Bowen about contacting the client and asking if our implementation is going to work for her (I wish communication with the client was an expectation for this class), and then started working on the implementaion. 

So far I have simplified the Location Service class that Keizo made last semester. The location service API that we are using does most of that stuff anyway and some of it needed to change. Next I added a loading screen for when you start the app. It does a few things that are nec for my location services like checking if it is the first time opening the app, and if it is, ask the user if they want to enable location services, and subsequent re-launches of the app checks if location services are enabled. It also does some other things that I thought would be handy like navigating to the instructions screen only if the user has opened the app the first time. 

Oh and I made it punny for fun
