-No suprises here but more bugs and small features

## Completed Features For This Week

-account profile deafualt picture. Now the profile page has a defualt profile picture that is non customizable
-screen transition. Instead of the white loading page that happens in between screen transitions now it is the background grey we use. This makes transitions more smooth.
-Login/Registration info bug. There was an issue where the login/registration info would be left in the input fields after they leave the page(even when logging out this was an issue). Now everytime someone leaves the login/register page, the information dissapears.

## Features in progress
