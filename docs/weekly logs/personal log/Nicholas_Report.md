## Completed Features For This Week

user_information/ratings on view post
-view_post was modified to accomplish this. There is a fucnction that gathers the data, I added it so it also retrieves the payload and creates an instance at the same time. With that instance it then retreives user_id first, then the username and ratings with said id. It then displays it.
-character limit on post list render
I applied a character limit put on the input fields title and description for create ad. I also shrunk the text size so it stops the text from overflowing on post into the image.
-conversation_end
If a user wants to end a conversation they can by pressing a soon to be button call end conversation.
It will take you to the end conversation screen where it will ask you if the food was succesfully delivered. If you say yes it will delete the post and send you to the reviews screen.

## Features in progress

-categories full function(waiting until after backend categories is comleted)
