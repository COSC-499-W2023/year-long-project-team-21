## Completed Features For This Week

-fixed color scheme from the user feedback. Some said that they couldn't intuetively understand what the color of the cards meant. So I changed the colors to green yellow and red to make it more understandinble. I also changed the front card to grey so that the coloured text with the expiery would stick out more.
-fixed the bugs on the image, so now they're square and completely visable
-changed the message button on the view post to match the current colour scheme.
-added a back button icon compoent with tests, since some users got confused trying to navigate home

## Features in progress
